## My process

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned how to handle svgs in react easily by installing SVGR library
- How to make responsive designs with Tailwinds default breakpoints
- How to use the @apply property in Tailwind


### Continued development

 - React hooks like UseRef and UseContext. Need to touch up knowledge on that

### Useful resources

- [Fix SVGR bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77284472/importing-svg-as-reactcomponent-in-vite-ambiguous-indirect-export-reactcompon) - This was useful to fix a bug with React SVGR library by using svgr/rollup library instead
